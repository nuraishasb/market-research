For my Statistical Methods for Market Research module project, I designed a research proposal for Nespresso. The proposal outlined a pragmatic plan, explaining how statistical methods would be applied to analyze data and extract meaningful insights. It detailed a straightforward yet comprehensive methodology and data collection process, aiming to uncover vital trends and consumer preferences.  I have also created targeted questionnaires specifically tailored to Nespresso's market, ensuring effective information gathering. This proposal acts as a practical guide, employing statistical methods for market research that align with Nespresso's objectives.
